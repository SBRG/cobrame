    "where $\\mu$ is the growth rate and $k_{eff}$ is an approximation of the effective turnover rate for the metabolic process. The coupling of enzyme synthesis cost to metabolic flux scales with $\\mu$ to represent the dilution of macromolecules as they are passed on the daughter cells. More macromolecules are therefore diluted at faster growth rates. Enzyme turnover rates determine the efficiency of an enzyme *in vivo* and are largly unknown for a majority of metabolic and expression-related enzymes. Optimizing the vector of $k_{eff}s$ for the cellular processes modeled in the ME-model is an ongoing area of research. \n",
    "\n",
    "Currently for the *E. coli* ME-model, the $k_{eff}s$ are set with an average of 65 $s^{-1}$ and scaled by their solvent accessible surface area (approximated as $protein\\_moleculare\\_weight^{\\frac{3}{4}}$). A set ~125 metabolic $k_{eff}s$ were found by [Ebrahim et. al. 2016](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27782110?dopt=Abstract) to be particularly important in *E. coli* for computing an accurate metabolic/proteomic state using proteomics data. We suspect similar observations would be seen in other organisms.\n",
    "\n",
    "For non metabolic macromolecules such as ribosome, mRNA, tRNA and RNA polymerase, the coupling constrains coefficients ('$k_{eff}s$') are derived by essentially back-calculating the individual rates using a measured RNA-to-Protein ratio from [Scott et. al. 2010](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21097934) and measured mRNA, tRNA and rRNA fractions. The coupling constraints coefficients for these macromolecules are derived in detail in [O'Brien et. al. 2013](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24084808). Applying these constraints results in a final nonlinear optimization problem (NLP) shown below. COBRAme reformulates these coupling constraints to embed them directly into the reaction which they are used as follows:"

As stated above, however, these were implemented in the current study as equality constraints . Effectively, this means that each ME-model solution will give the computed optimal proteome allocation for the *in silico* conditions. Previous ME-model formulations have applied the constraints as inequalities thus allowing the simulation to overproduce macromolecule components. While overproduction is seen *in vivo* in cells, this phenomenon would not be selected as the optimal solution. Furthermore, using inequality constraints greatly expands the size of the possible solution space significantly increasing the time required to solve the optimization.  Reformulating the model using equality constraints thus resulted in a reduced ME-matrix with the coupling constraints embedded directly into the reaction in which they are used."
