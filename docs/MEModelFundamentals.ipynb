    "Coupling constraints are required in an ME-model in order to couple a reaction flux to the synthesis of the macromolecule catalyzing the flux. The easiest example of this is for the coupling of metabolic enzymes to metabolic reactions. This has the form:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\frac{\\mu}{k_{eff}}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $\\mu$ is the growth rate and $k_{eff}$ is an approximation of the effective turnover rate for the metabolic process. The coupling of enzyme synthesis cost to metabolic flux scales with $\\mu$ to represent the dilution of macromolecules as they are passed on the daughter cells. More macromolecules are diluted at faster growth rates. Enzyme turnover rates determine the efficiency of of an enzyme *in vivo* and are largly unknown for a majority of metabolic and expression enzymes. Optimizing the vector of $k_{eff}s$ for the cellular processes modeled in the ME-model is an ongoing area of research. Currently, the $k_{eff}s$ are set with an average of 65 $s^{-1}$ and scaled by their solvent accessible surface area (approximated as $protein\\_moleculare\\_weight^{\\frac{3}{4}}$). A set ~125 metabolic $k_{eff}s$ were found by [Ebrahim et. al. 2016](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27782110?dopt=Abstract) to be particularly important in *E. coli* for computing an accurate metabolic/proteomic state using proteomics data. We suspect similar observations would be seen in other organisms.\n",
    "\n",
    "For non metabolic macromolecules such as ribosome, mRNA, tRNA and RNA polymerase, the coupling constrains coefficients ('$k_{eff}s$') are derived by essentially back-calculating the individual rates using a measured RNA-to-Protein ratio from [Scott et. al. 2010](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21097934) and measured mRNA, tRNA and rRNA fractions. The coupling constraints coefficients for these macromolecules are derived in detail in [O'Brien et. al. 2013](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24084808). Applying these constraints results in a final nonlinear optimization problem (NLP) shown below.

As stated above, however, these were implemented in the current study as equality constraints . Effectively, this means that each ME-model solution will give the computed optimal proteome allocation for the *in silico* conditions. Previous ME-model formulations have applied the constraints as inequalities thus allowing the simulation to overproduce macromolecule components. While overproduction is seen *in vivo* in cells, this phenomenon would not be selected as the optimal solution. Furthermore, using inequality constraints greatly expands the size of the possible solution space significantly increasing the time required to solve the optimization.  Reformulating the model using equality constraints thus resulted in a reduced ME-matrix with the coupling constraints embedded directly into the reaction in which they are used.\n"

    "For metabolic models (M-models), the biomass objective function has been used to represent the amount of biomass\n",

The metabolites represented in the biomass function are typically building blocks for major macromolecules (e.g. amino acids and nucleotides), cell wall components and cofactors. The coefficients of the biomass objective function are determined from empirical measurements from a cell growing at a measured rate. Since ME-models explicitly compute the predicted amount of RNA, protein, cofactors, etc. necessary for growth, this concept has to be modified for ME models.\n",

    "This is accomplished via the *biomass_dilution* variable (reaction), which contains the *biomass* constraint (pseudo metabolite) that represents the mass produced by the synthesis of each functional RNA or protein.
